    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p> My name is Krisnah but you can call me Kris. 
    I am from Madagascar. I am not married and don't have kids yet. 
    I work as a news sequencer in a small company here in my country. 
    I like reading, listening to music, watching movies and anime.
    I study web and computer programming at BYU Idaho because I want to become a computer engineer. 
    I hope we can help each other here.
    I also like to make new friends and discover other cultures, so don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
    <p> Thank you for coming ! &#128516; </p>
